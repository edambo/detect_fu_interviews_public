# Load the necessary packages
```{r}
#| warning: false
library(codebookr)
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(haven)
library(readr)
```

# Purpose of the program

Using the CodebookR package, we will create a data dictionary for follow-up interview data for the DETECT project pertaining to APS.

# Load cleaned data
```{r}
#| warning: false
aps_inv <- read_rds("../data/cleaned_rds_files/aps_investigations_import.rds")
```

# Set column attributes

```{r}
# Set the source to "DETECT Follow-up Interview APS Investigations" for all the variables
aps_vars <- aps_inv %>% 
  names()

for(i in aps_vars) {
  attr(aps_inv[[i]], "source") <- "DETECT Follow-up Interview APS Investigations"
}
```

```{r}
# Add column attributes to all variables
