# Purpose of the program

Using the CodebookR package, we will create a data dictionary for follow-up interview data for the DETECT project pertaining to home inspection and the clutter image rating scale

# Load cleaned data
```{r}
#| warning: false
clutter_scale <- read_rds("../data/cleaned_rds_files/clutter_scale_import.rds")
```

# Glimpse data with every column shown
```{r}
glimpse(clutter_scale)
```

# Set column attributes

```{r}
# Set the source to "DETECT Follow-up Interview home inspection and the clutter image rating scale data" for all the variables
clutter_scale_vars <- clutter_scale %>% 
  select(1:29) %>%
  names()

for(i in clutter_scale_vars) {
  attr(clutter_scale[[i]], "source") <- "DETECT Follow-up Interview Clutter Scale"
}
```
