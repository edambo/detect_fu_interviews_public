# Purpose of the program

Using the CodebookR package, we will create a data dictionary for follow-up interview data for the DETECT project pertaining to observational measures.

# Load cleaned data

```{r}
#| warning: false
observational_measures_import.rds <- file.choose()
obs <- readRDS(observational_measures_import.rds)
```

# Set column attributes

```{r}
#Set the source to "DETECT Follow-up Interview Questions Observational Measures" for all the variables
obs_vars <- obs %>% 
  select(1:125) %>% 
  names()

for(i in obs_vars) {
  attr(obs[[i]], "source") <- "DETECT Follow-up Interview Questions Observational Measures"
}
```

```{r}
# Choose variables that will not have summary statistics
no_stats <- obs %>%
  select(1:13,16:29,131)

no_stats_vars <- colnames(no_stats)
