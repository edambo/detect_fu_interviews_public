# Panelist multiple assessment data error problem description

## There is an error in the LEAD panel assessment data where there are multiple rows of data for certain panelists in the same assessment 
## of the same participant.
## For instance, medstar_id 47311d550da4471297501ae2b3b03b02 has multiple rows with Jason Burnett as the LEAD panelist in the initial assessment
## within a short time frame. 

# Identify Medstar IDs with data error and remove rows based on certain criteria.

## Create a function that identifies the specific issues, indicates whether a row should be excluded or not and then removes the identified rows based
## on the following criteria:
## 1. Identical duplicates: Keep the most recent row.
## 2. Additional entries with all values missing : Remove rows with all missing vote values
## 3. Additional entries where not all values are missing: Keep only the most recent
