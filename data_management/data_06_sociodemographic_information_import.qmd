# Load the data

Load the data table into the global environment as a data frame using the raw csv file. We will create categorical variables with numerical values that match the codebook and also create a factor variable for each categorical variable in the data frame to be used for analysis.

```{r}

sociodemographic_information <- read_csv("../data/filemaker_pro_exports/sociodemographic_information_import.csv")

``` 

# Clean the data

Here we will convert all variable names to snake case so that everything is uniform.

```{r}
# Convert all variable names to snake case

sociodemographic_information <- clean_names(sociodemographic_information)
```

## Coerce categorical variables to factor variables

### Sociodemographic Information

Create factor variables and match levels to codebook for all categorical variables except sode_race.
